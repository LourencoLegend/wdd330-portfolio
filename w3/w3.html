            <p> Testing and debugging are important activities during software development and maintenance.</p>
            <p> Testing is performed to check if the code contains errors whereas debugging is done to locate and fix these errors.</p>
            <p> Testing can be manual or automated and can be of different types such as unit, integration, system, stress etc. Debugging can also be manual or automated.</p>
            <p> These two activities have drawn attention of researchers in the recent years.</p>
            <p> Past studies have proposed many testing techniques such as automated test generation, test minimization, test case selection etc.</p>
            <p> Studies related to debugging have proposed new techniques to find bugs using various fault localization schemes such as spectrum-based fault localization, IR-based fault localization, program slicing, delta debugging etc. to accurately and efficiently find bugs. However, even after years of research software continues to have bugs, which can have significant implications for the organization and economy.</p>
            <p>Often developers mention that the number of bugs they receive for the project overwhelms the resources they have.<>

            <p>Developers should always try to create good test cases based on
                several characteristics such as size and complexity, coverage, maintainability, bug
                detection etc. </p> 
        <h3>Single page website</h3>
            <p>A single-page website is slightly different than a one-page website.</p> 
            <p>One-page websites are literally one-page; there are no navigational links to give you the illusion that the page is changing.</p>
            <p>A single-page website is a type of single-page application (SPA) that dynamically displays content from the server in response to user interaction versus loading the page as a whole.</p>
            <p>Users click on navigation links to jump (or scroll) to destinations further down the page. This interaction gives the impression that the page is changing; however, there is no page refresh.</p>
        <br>
            <p>Single-page websites look great and are fun to build, but are they good for SEO?</p>            
                <p>Pros</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better Mobile Experience</li>
                    <li>One of the major advantages of the single-page design is that the sites typically convert much easier to mobile, and users find them simple to navigate.</li>
                    <li>Single-page websites Target A Specific Audience; <br>
                    Single-page websites are great for targeting a specific audience and providing them with a certain type of user experience.</li>
                    <li>It’s easy to control their behavior on your site and steer them in one particular direction if you don’t have to worry about them clicking on various pages, possibly in the wrong order.</li>
                    <li>With a single-page site, all the information you want users to access can be presented to them on one page, in whatever order you choose to suit the needs of your business.</li>
                    <li>PageRank; <br>
                        Links are one of the largest factors that determine how well a website ranks and the benefit that a single-page website has going for it is that every link acquired will point to the main URL, so there will always be a 1:1 ratio of links to pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cons</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Keyword Targeting <br>Single-page sites are generally supposed to be designed around one main concept, which limits your ability to rank for a wide variety of keywords.</li>
                <li>Content Lacks Detail <br>
                    single-page sites is that their content is generally not as specific as what publishes on multi-page sites.</li>
                <li>It’s impossible to cover the same amount of information on one page as it is on multiple pages.</li>
                <li>Advanced SEO strategies and best practices aren’t available when working with a single-page site.</li>
            <p>When determining whether your site should be single or multi-page, you need to consider the goals for your business and what you’re trying to accomplish with your website.</p>
